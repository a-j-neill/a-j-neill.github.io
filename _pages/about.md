I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate within the Institute of Hazard, Risk and Resilience at Durham Univeristy (UK). My research focusses on understanding the sources and pathways of agricultural pollutants (microbial and nutrients) to receiving waters. Central to this is the fusion of models with complimentary data streams (e.g., water quality parameters, stable water isotopes, ecohydrological monitoring) to improve confidence in model outputs. I am particularly interested in using agent-based approaches to trace the fate and transport of pollutants in the landscape and am the developer of the Model for the Agent-based simulation of Faecal Indicator Organisms (MAFIO).

I am currently developing a major strand of research around agricultural water pollution in tropical environments. This work will have two main foci: 1) The Lake Victoria Basin in E. Africa with an initial emphasis on Kenya; 2) The Tempisque River basin in north-west Costa Rica. The overarching aim of the research is to develop an evidence base and decision support tool that can help inform the use of nature-based solutions to impaired water quality arising from agriculture (e.g. nutrients, sediment and microbial). This work will be an interdisciplinary collaboration with multiple colleagues and stakeholders, integrating qualitative and quantitative data collection, model development and community engagement. 

I am also interested in exploring new approaches for visualising model output and uncertainty to aid effective communication with stakeholders.

Prior to my current position, I was based at the University of Aberdeen for seven years. Here, I obtained my PhD on advancing models of microbial water quality (in collaboration with the James Hutton Institute), before progressing to my first postdoc position working on the “Isotopes in ecohydrological models to manage land use change impacts” (ISO-LAND) project.
