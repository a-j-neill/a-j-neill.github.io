My research spans two linked yet distinct areas of hydrology: 1) The advancement of ecohydrological process understanding, and 2) Tracing the sources and flow paths that contribute agricultural pollutants (microbial and nutrients) to receiving waters.<br>
<br>
Central to my work is the fusion of models with complimentary data streams (e.g., water quality parameters, stable water isotopes, ecohydrological monitoring) to improve confidence in model outputs. I am particularly interested in using agent-based approaches to trace the movement of water and pollutants in the landscape, and am the developer of the Model for the Agent-based simulation of Faecal Indicator Organisms (MAFIO).<br>
<br>
I am currently advancing a major strand of research around water pollution (e.g. nutrients, sediment and microbial) arising from commercial plantation agriculture. This work will have an initial emphasis on Kenya before moving to the scale of the whole Lake Victoria Basin (E. Africa). The overarching aim of the research is to develop an evidence base and decision support tool that can help inform the use of nature-based solutions to impaired water quality. This work will be an interdisciplinary collaboration with multiple colleagues and stakeholders, integrating qualitative and quantitative data collection, model development and community engagement.<br>
<br>
I am also in the early stages of devising projects to address research questions at the intersection of ecohydrology and biogeochemistry. These projects will leverage data and insights afforded by the Water Analysis Trailer for Environmental Research (WATER), a mobile, trailer-based, high-temporal-resolution water sampling platform developed at the Institute for Landscape Ecology and Resources Management, Justus Liebig University Giessen (Germany).<br>
<br>
My PhD on Advancing Models of Microbial Water Quality was awarded by the University of Aberdeen and undertaken in collaboration with the James Hutton Institute (2015-2019). I remained at the University of Aberdeen for my first postdoctoral position until August 2022. From September 2022 to February 2024, I was based within the Institute of Hazard, Risk and Resilience at Durham University (UK) as a postdoctoral research associate working on hydrological hazards.<br>
<br>
In March 2024, I joined the Institute for Landscape Ecology and Resources Management at the Justus Liebig University Giessen (Germany) as a postdoctoral researcher.<br>
