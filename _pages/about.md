My research focusses on understanding the sources and pathways of agricultural pollutants (microbial and nutrients) to receiving waters. Central to this is the fusion of models with complimentary data streams (e.g., water quality parameters, stable water isotopes, ecohydrological monitoring) to improve confidence in model outputs. I am particularly interested in using agent-based approaches to trace the fate and transport of pollutants in the landscape and am the developer of the Model for the Agent-based simulation of Faecal Indicator Organisms (MAFIO).<br>
I am currently developing a major strand of research around agricultural water pollution in tropical environments. This work will have two main foci: 1) The Lake Victoria Basin in E. Africa with an initial emphasis on Kenya; 2) The Tempisque River basin in north-west Costa Rica. The overarching aim of the research is to develop an evidence base and decision support tool that can help inform the use of nature-based solutions to impaired water quality arising from agriculture (e.g. nutrients, sediment and microbial). This work will be an interdisciplinary collaboration with multiple colleagues and stakeholders, integrating qualitative and quantitative data collection, model development and community engagement.<br>
I am also interested in exploring new approaches for visualising model output and uncertainty to aid effective communication with stakeholders.<br>
My PhD on Advancing Models of Microbial Water Quality was awarded by the University of Aberdeen and undertaken in collaboration with the James Hutton Institute. Following my PhD, I progressed to my first postdoc position working on the “Isotopes in ecohydrological models to manage land use change impacts” (ISO-LAND) project. Since September 2022, I have been based within the Institute of Hazard, Risk and Resilience at Durham University (UK) as a postdoctoral research associate.
